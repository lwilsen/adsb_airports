### What is ADS-B Data?

ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillanceâ€“Broadcast) is a surveillance technology used in aviation for tracking aircraft. It provides precise location and status information through messages transmitted by aircraft and picked up by ground stations or satellites.

Below is a detailed explanation of the different fields available in the data.

---

## Basic Aircraft Information
  
- **`alt_baro`**: Barometric altitude in feet.  
- **`gs`**: Ground speed of the aircraft in knots.  
- **`track`**: Heading of the aircraft in degrees, measured clockwise from north.  
- **`category`**: Classification of the aircraft based on size and type.  

---

## Position and Navigation Data

- **`lat`**: Latitude in degrees.  
- **`lon`**: Longitude in degrees.
