"""
This script explores a dataset of grounded airplanes.

It reads a pickled DataFrame from 'grounded.pkl' and performs the following:

1. **Displays a descriptive text:** Provides context about the data and analysis.
2. **Displays a table:** Shows a tabular representation of the first few rows of the DataFrame.
3. **Plots histograms:** Visualizes the distribution of latitude, longitude, and ground speed using Matplotlib.
    - Latitude histogram: Shows the frequency of different latitude values.
    - Longitude histogram: Shows the frequency of different longitude values.
    - Ground Speed histogram: Shows the frequency of different ground speed values.
4. **Displays the plots:** Uses Streamlit to render the Matplotlib figures in the web app.
